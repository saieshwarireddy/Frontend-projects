 <p>In this Naruto series, an organization that includes many of the most famous villains is the Akatsuki organization.

Akatsuki is a criminal organization consisting of a group of evil ninjas banished from the village, whose main mission is to gather the power of beasts so that they can rule the world.

They usually wear black robes with red clouds. When going on missions, Akatsuki members always pair up 2 people. Initially Akatsuki was led by Nagato, but later Akatsuki was led by Obito Uchiha, who wanted to create a Genjutsu world.

There are several Akatsuki members, including Orochimaru, who has left the organization, and Zetsu, a mutant consisting of a white Zetsu and a black Zetsu. They are shinobi with great and terrible power and have a deadly and extraordinary jutsu.</p>
